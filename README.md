# (x-)forwarded*  Filter

Standalone (x-)forwarded* Filter.

The (x-)forwarded*  Http Headers are a pseudo standard with varying and mostly lacking support in most products.

Supported Http Headers:
-  `Forwarded` [as of RFC 7239](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7239)
- or if `Forwarded` header is NOT found:
  - `X-Forwarded-Host`
  - `X-Forwarded-Port`
  - `X-Forwarded-Proto`
- Additionally for both cases: `X-Forwarded-Prefix` to adapt the `getContextPath` result is supported.

Features:
- Supports adapting the scheme, host, port and prefix(contextPath) of `HttpServletRequest`'s by replacing them transparently using the information from the (x-)forwarded* header(s).
- Supports `HttpServletResponse.sendRedirect(location)` by rewriting them accordingly
- Processing of headers and extracting parts (e.g. form `Forwarded` ) is case insensitive
  - valid: X-Forwarded-Host, x-forwarded-host, X-forwarded-HOST,..
- Supports multiple headers of same name in request -> use Find-First-Strategy
  - e.g.<br/>
    X-Forwarded-Host: "hostA"<br/>
    X-Forwarded-Host: "hostB"   => filter will use "hostA" 
- Supports multiple COMMA-SPACE separated values inside a headers value ->use Find-First-Strategy
  - e.g. X-Forwarded-Host: "hostA, hostB"  => filter will use "hostA"
- Configurable processing strategy for `X-Forwarded-Prefix` =>  PREPEND or REPLACE the contextPath
  `ForwardedFilter.xForwardedPrefixStrategy=[PREPEND, REPLACE]`
- Configurable header processing and removal strategy
  `ForwardedFilter.headerProcessingStrategy=[EVAL_AND_KEEP, EVAL_AND_REMOVE, DONT_EVAL_AND_REMOVE]`
  - EVAL_AND_KEEP - process headers and keep them in the list of headers for downstream processing
  - EVAL_AND_REMOVE - process headers and remove them. Wont be visible any more when accessing getHeader(s)
  - DONT_EVAL_AND_REMOVE - don't process the headers, just remove them.
  - ~~DONT_EVAL_AND_DONT_REMOVE~~ => just don't activate this filter - same effect

## Why do I need (x-)forwarded

1. Imagine your applications sits behind a proxy or a chain of proxies
2. Imagine your application is reachable over different DNS names 
 
Now you require, for whatever reason, the exact URL - as the client calling you sees it - your where called with.
For example because you want to redirect you client to another URL/Service (e.g. a login service), lets call this service 'FOO' and you require 'FOO' to send the user back to you after he's done - hence requiring your service to tell 'FOO' the exact URL as the clients browser used to contact you in order to send him back to you.
  
Therefore you require the protocol, host, port and maybe the prefix form `HttpServletRequest` to reconstruct the original URL.

Without a mechanism aware of "forwarded" headers your `HttpServletRequest` does only contain the protocol, host and port with which the proxyserver calling you connected to your service - probably  some internal dns address and port.
Furthermore the proxy may strips some prefix form your request path - for example because it maps maps multiple services behind a single domain

To support this usecase many proxies support adding (x-)forwarded* header.

Unfortunately many frameworks and webservers have very bad support for these (pseudo-)standard forwarded headers, implement them poorly or lack the support completely.

Add this filter and it will transparently take care of these concerns for you by wrapping the `HttpServletRequest` which will overwrite various methods to return the correct information.
 
## Why do I use THIS filter
 
Because most libraries and webservers have very varying and mostly lacking support.
The best Filter we could find was the [Spring ForwardedHeaderFilter](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/master/spring-web/src/main/java/org/springframework/web/filter/ForwardedHeaderFilter.java)
But
  - it requires the complete spring-web as dendency (fine if your are allready using spring - not so fine for a single filter)
  - it lacks support for PREPEND the value in X-Forwarded-Prefix instead of REPLACE (which is crucial for us)
  
## What this filter is not
- no support for "client identification" with x-forwarded-for
 
## Dependencies

The JARs are available via Maven Central and JCenter. 

If you are using Maven to build your project, add the following to the `pom.xml` file.

```XML
<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/de.qaware.xff/x-forwarded-filter -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>de.qaware.xff</groupId>
    <artifactId>x-forwarded-filter</artifactId>
    <version>1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

In case you are using Gradle to build your project, add the following to the `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
repositories {
    jcenter()
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    // https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/de.qaware.xff/x-forwarded-filter
    compile group: 'de.qaware.xff', name: 'x-forwarded-filter', version: '1.0'
}
```
 
## Usage
You probably should disable all other x-forwarded processing code - like done by your underlying webserver.

### SpringBoot
```java
import de.qaware.xff.filter.ForwardedHeaderFilter;  //warning! dont trust the autoimport as it will likley use org.springframework.web.filter.ForwardedHeaderFilter 
//..
@Configuration
public class MyFilterConfig{
    @Bean
    FilterRegistrationBean forwardedHeaderFilter() {
        FilterRegistrationBean frb = new FilterRegistrationBean();
        frb.setFilter(new ForwardedHeaderFilter());
        //must run as first filter
        frb.setOrder(Ordered.HIGHEST_PRECEDENCE);
        //Configuration options and their defaults
        frb.addInitParameter(ForwardedHeaderFilter.ENABLE_RELATIVE_REDIRECTS_INIT_PARAM, Boolean.FALSE.toString());//false is default
        frb.addInitParameter(ForwardedHeaderFilter.HEADER_PROCESSING_STRATEGY, HeaderProcessingStrategy.EVAL_AND_REMOVE.name());//EVAL_AND_REMOVE is default
        frb.addInitParameter(ForwardedHeaderFilter.X_FORWARDED_PREFIX_STRATEGY, XForwardedPrefixStrategy.REPLACE.name()); //Replace is default
        return frb;
    }
}
```

### web.xml (e.g. websphere liberty or Spring)

```xml
<!--ForwardedHeaderFilter MUST be first filter in chain -->
<filter>
    <filter-name>ForwardedHeaderFilter</filter-name>
    <filter-class>de.qaware.xff.filter.ForwardedHeaderFilter</filter-class>
    <init-param>
        <param-name>headerProcessingStrategy</param-name>
        <param-value>EVAL_AND_REMOVE</param-value>
    </init-param>
    <init-param>
        <param-name>xForwardedPrefixStrategy</param-name>
        <param-value>REPLACE</param-value>
    </init-param>
    <!--
    <init-param>
        <param-name>enableRelativeRedirects</param-name>
        <param-value>false</param-value>
    </init-param>
    -->
</filter>
<filter-mapping>
    <filter-name>ForwardedHeaderFilter</filter-name>
    <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
</filter-mapping>
```

### Disable other (x-)forwarded* header processing in various products
#### Websphere liberty
Disable [trustedHeaderOrigin](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/beta/SSEQTJ_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.nd.doc/ae/rwlp_config_httpDispatcher.html#rwlp_config_httpDispatcher__trustedHeaderOrigin) inside server.xml 
`<httpDispatcher trustedHeaderOrigin="none" />`

#### Spring
 1. Don't register the org.springframework.web.filter.ForwardedHeaderFilter
 2. Set `server.use-forward-headers=false` - generically turns off the forward header handling in the underlying webserver! (e.g. tomcat's RemoteIpValve) see: ["howto-use-tomcat-behind-a-proxy-server"](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/howto-embedded-servlet-containers.html#howto-use-tomcat-behind-a-proxy-server")

#### Tomcat
Don't register RemoteIpValve in TomcatEmbeddedServletContainerFactory
```java
void configureTomcatXForwardedHandling(TomcatEmbeddedServletContainerFactory factory){
  if(xForwardedHandlingByTomcat){
	RemoteIpValve remoteIpValve = new RemoteIpValve();
	factory.addContextValves(remoteIpValve);
  }
}	 
```  

## Implementation Details
Based on [Springs ForwardedHeaderFilter](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/master/spring-web/src/main/java/org/springframework/web/filter/ForwardedHeaderFilter.java) but
 - without Spring dependency -> easily integrable into many projects
 - has toogle to NOT remove the evaluated headers from the request 
   - allows using this filter inside a Proxy to forward/append to these headers to downstream services (e.g. Zuul)
 - Selectable processing strategy for `X-Forwarded-Prefix`  
   - `PREPEND` the Context-Path of the Application with the (first) value from `X-forwarded-Prefix`
     -  example:
   - `REPLACE` the Context-Path of the Application with the (first) value from `X-forwarded-Prefix`
     -  example:
 
## How to build 
Based on Gradle. First trigger of build will take longer and download the buildtool.
execute:
`gradlew build`
